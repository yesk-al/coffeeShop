I love the variety I get from my subscription that's still tailored to the way I brew and enjoy my coffee. Still a tad expensive, but consistent quality and freshness is often worth the price."</p>

      <p>"I received an offer to try this for $5.99 through Brad's Deals. I just about completed the offer but noticed a cleverly hidden message about this being the first month's order. I am not sure if I was signing up for a monthly order or not, but it could be --maybe. If ot was hidden that I was signing up for a monthly charge, shame on this company. If I am being too skeptical, then my bad."</p></div>

      <p>"Love, love, LOVE getting my Bean Box. My son got me this subscription as a gift and it's the highlight of my month. Then, brewing up a mid-afternoon cup is a daily ritual ... Love it! Rather than focusing on one particular roaster, I enjoy the variety and surprise that each one brings. Thanks, to you all! -Kyle"</p></div>
